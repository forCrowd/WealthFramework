. try to merge unit of work classes - resourcepool unitofwork could create sector + license + organization for instance?
. be careful about different contexts entities - license.resourcepool = sampleResourcePool was creating new resource pools!
either work with Ids, or try to work on merging unitofwork classes
. remove satisfaction word..?
. find vs. deleted records? - findlive? or don't retrieve dead records at all?
. exists should work with find or alllive.any() or all.any() ?
. breeze - check save + has + get + reject changes. currently they don't work on entity level? - also prepareBatch method?
. use or try to remove scripts.render() + styles.render() from layout.cshtml - then mvc can be removed completely
. automate .tt scripts with afterbuild?
. sometimes cancel button doesn't allow to go back (fill required?)
.. use history.back sort of method, but first vm needs to be a new object, without createEntity
. learn this disposable thingy? repo + unitofwork + context + controllers?
. implement soft delete
. handling concurrency can be improved - load the new record and let the user choose which one is correct
. html cache break - angular scripts + views etc.?
. try to create initial data from facade, instead of dataobjects layer
. don't allow delete License if it's connected to an Organization (can't be deleted) - same goes for the others but License really can't be deleted
. create sample data with average rating value? or make the rating nullable
. multiple pk for user organization + user sector + user license + user resource pool organization + resource pool organization
. table structure - by this way, userresourcepool could reach to usersectorrating easily?;
user - resourcepool - userresourcepoolId
userresourcepoolsector -> userresourcepoolId sectorId rating
userresourcepoollicense -> userresourcepoolId licenseId rating
userresourcepoolorganization -> userresourcepoolId organizationId rating
. exclude sample user from rating averages - or make them always 50 / 50?
. using numbers in sector chart page didn't work, it breaks the chart?
. authorize only for admins didnt work - license, organization, resourcepool, sector
any user should be able to access them. currently definitions link is only visible to admins - according to this, normal user may not use post action for instance? check these rules later on
. try to have a standard for css usage + html layout formats + also js script conventions
. check spelling of the texts!
. update namespaces - osp.wealtheconomy.
. enabled auto test for appveyor
. in some delete cases, odatacontroller returns NotFound error? although it's deleted, the record stays on the page until refreshing the page
. how to calculate average index? some people may enter 1,2,3 - some may enter 100,200,300? always force them to enter percentage?
or always calculate the total average based on invidiuals percentage? or both?
. __migrationhistory createdon field error - it seems there is not much to do, it also might be about glimpse?
. upgrade to .net 4.5.1? APM doesn't have it right now
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh925568%28v=vs.110%29.aspx

. validateantiforgerytoken + bind attributes in odata controller?

. odata - paging (also filters?)
querayable vs enablequerysupport
[Queryable(PageSize=10)]

var queryAttribute = new QueryableAttribute()
{
    AllowedQueryOptions = AllowedQueryOptions.Top | AllowedQueryOptions.Skip,
    MaxTop = 100
};
config.EnableQuerySupport(queryAttribute);

. loading animation? both for breeze + angular

. try to add indexes dynamically?

. vs update 2 changes?
.. asp.net identity

. try turning off lazy loading - then how it brings the data (resourcepool for instance?)
.. currently there seem no good case that lazy loading is beneficial?
. and how about disabling proxy classes? what will be the difference exactly?

. default license ratings should be 50/50
. and ratings total should always be 100%

. cascade delete alterations;
UserResourcePoolIndex..ForeignKey("dbo.ResourcePoolIndex", t => t.ResourcePoolIndexId, cascadeDelete: false)
UserResourcePoolIndexValue.ForeignKey("dbo.Organization", t => t.OrganizationId, cascadeDelete: false)

. this is not a correct calculation / it finds the average by dividing all users' total to current users total cost ?! test + fix all!
        public decimal TotalCostIndexRatingWeightedAverage
        {
            get
            {
                if (ResourcePool.TotalIndexRating == 0)
                    return 0;

                return TotalCostIndexRating / ResourcePool.TotalIndexRating;
            }
        }
		
. this is not on a correct level - it had to be on organization level - fix all ?!
        public decimal EmployeeSatisfactionIndexPercentage
        {
            get
            {
                return UserResourcePool.ResourcePool.EmployeeSatisfactionRatingAverage == 0
                    ? 0
                    : Organization.GetAverageEmployeeSatisfactionRating() / UserResourcePool.ResourcePool.EmployeeSatisfactionRatingAverage;
            }
        }

user resource pool index dto! currently this gives an error;
http://localhost:10001/api/ResourcePoolIndexCustom/ResourcePoolIndexOrganizationSet

---
test cases;
. multiple index case - update index ratings and see!

. try to fix the following case and check ?!
.. about indexvalue income calculation, there are two weighted average calculation, couldn't be only one? weighted -> weighted * number of sales -> weightedwithnumberofsales weighted?

---
sector index - just name and the rating
license index - name + boolean variables and the rating
organization total cost index - auto formula (organization sales price / resource pool sales price average)
organization quality index (at this moment) - name and the rating
organization emp sat index - name and the rating
organization cust sat index - name and the rating

three different levels (can more more)

---
resource pool types: realtime vs. static

---
resource pool types;
. index samples
. one big public
. per user

organizations - per resource pool?

---
Index Notes;

total cost	-> lowest
knowledge	-> highest
quality		-> highest
sector		-> highest
employee	-> highest
customer	-> highest
distance	-> lowest

user can rate;
license (knowledge index)
organization quality
sector
organization employee satisf.
organization customer satisf.

auto;
total cost	= sales price - production cost
distance	= production location - customer location

---
Using Total Cost Index without other Indexes wouldn't make sense.
If the quality of the product is not known, rewarding low cost wouldn't mean much?
Maybe it's better to start with another index?
New comment: Actually this should be okay, because in the current economic system it's the same.
We don't look quality and other details but just low cost + max. profit. Same ignorance.
