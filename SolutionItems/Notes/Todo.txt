. breeze - check save + has + get + reject changes. currently they don't work on entity level? - also prepareBatch method?

. sometimes cancel button doesn't allow to go back (fill required?)
.. use history.back sort of method, but first vm needs to be a new object, without createEntity

. learn this disposable thingy? repo + unitofwork + context + controllers?
. handling concurrency can be improved - load the new record and let the user choose which one is correct
. try to create initial data from facade, instead of dataobjects layer
. check whether unit of work classes need merging
.. however, in the current structure, every entity will have a unitofwork + controller by default?
.. be careful about different contexts entities - license.resourcepool = sampleResourcePool was creating new resource pools!
either work with Ids, or try to work on merging unitofwork classes

. implement soft delete
. find vs. deleted records? - findlive? or don't retrieve dead records at all?
. exists should work with find or alllive.any() or all.any() ?
. don't allow delete License if it's connected to an Organization (can't be deleted) - same goes for the others but License really can't be deleted

. multiple pk cases for user organization + user sector + user license + user resource pool organization + resource pool organization
. table structure - by this way, userresourcepool could reach to ratings/values easily;
User - Resourcepool - UserresourcepoolId
UserResourcePoolElementCell -> UserResourcePoolId ElementCellId?

. authorize only for admins didnt work - license, organization, resourcepool, sector
any user should be able to access them. currently definitions link is only visible to admins - according to this, normal user may not use post action for instance? check these rules later on

. loading animation? both for breeze + angular
. enum data type didnt work with odata? or api?
. html cache break - angular scripts + views etc.?
. using texbox to update chart data didn't work, it breaks the chart?
. use or try to remove scripts.render() + styles.render() from layout.cshtml - then mvc can be removed completely
. automate .tt scripts with afterbuild?
. try to have a standard for css usage + html layout formats + also js script conventions
. check spelling of the texts!
. enable auto test for appveyor - currently it fails probably because it can't create the db?
. __migrationhistory createdon field error - it seems there is not much to do, it also might be about glimpse?
. upgrade to .net 4.5.1?
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh925568%28v=vs.110%29.aspx
. what to do these lines; datacontext.js - batches.push(manager.getEntities(['License'], [breeze.EntityState.Deleted]));

. default license ratings should be 50/50
. and ratings total should always be 100%
. create sample data with average rating value? or make the rating nullable
. exclude sample user from rating averages - or make them always 50 / 50?
. how to calculate average index? some people may enter 1,2,3 - some may enter 100,200,300? always force them to enter percentage?
or always calculate the total average based on invidiuals percentage? or both?
. in 'not rated index' case, userResourcePool view doesn't show the result
. in 'not rated organizations' case, it's collecting the tax but not giving it back? - basically how to treat an organization that doesn't have any rating?

. validateantiforgerytoken + bind attributes in odata controller?

. odata - paging (also filters?)
querayable vs enablequerysupport
[Queryable(PageSize=10)]

var queryAttribute = new QueryableAttribute()
{
    AllowedQueryOptions = AllowedQueryOptions.Top | AllowedQueryOptions.Skip,
    MaxTop = 100
};
config.EnableQuerySupport(queryAttribute);

. try turning off lazy loading - then how it brings the data (resourcepool for instance?)
.. currently there seem no good case that lazy loading is beneficial?
. and how about disabling proxy classes? what will be the difference exactly?

. result of datetime (ticks) index is bit useless? need reference a start or end date as a reference?

. vs update 2 + 3 changes?

. update configuration.cs with element fields
. employee + customer + quality index samples are not there
. all in one + sector samples are outdated
. check userunitofwork + resourcepoolunitofwork + userresourcepoolunitofwork for sample records + delete cases
. add multiple fields test
. check [required] attribute for newer classes?

. unitofwork taking dbcontext as a parameter in the constructor case? passing an initialized context, is it safe at all?
check asp.net identity

. breeze.debug.js, commented out -> //if (prefix[0] === '/') { prefix = prefix.substr(1); } // drop leading '/'  (all but IE)      

. highcharts library loading perf?

. odata4 upgrade was failed; breeze doesn't support it yet!

. make even the name as a element item and create it automatically when the element is created

. try to convert other batch files to ps scripts as well

. currently multiplier + resource pool field types can only be added once per element (or resource pool) - check it again

. fixed amount resourcepooltype

. resourcepoolindex can be a field for elementfield table? Index boolean?

. web api throttling!

. unit testing;
.. webapi library tests or webapi tests as web service?

. ismainelement -> DefaultElement
. multiplier field type -> userelementcell can hold just the value but will be used as it is, not it's average (like Rating)
currently number of sales is not on user level, but on elementitem level!
. userelementcell rating -> value?
. instead of MainElement boolean on Element level, can it be done with MainElement field on ResourcePool level? yes, with InverseProperty
. subtotals; sales price, sales price incl. tax, number of sales, total tax, total sales price incl. tax, total income
. userelementcell ratings + counts?
. display index's own ratings + counts?
