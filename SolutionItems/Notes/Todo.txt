. breeze - check save + has + get + reject changes. currently they don't work on entity level? - also prepareBatch method?

. sometimes cancel button doesn't allow to go back (fill required?)
.. use history.back sort of method, but first vm needs to be a new object, without createEntity

. learn this disposable thingy? repo + unitofwork + context + controllers?
. handling concurrency can be improved - load the new record and let the user choose which one is correct
. try to create initial data from facade, instead of dataobjects layer
. try to merge unit of work classes - resourcepool unitofwork could create sector + license + organization for instance?
.. however, in the current structure, every entity will have a unitofwork + controller by default?
.. be careful about different contexts entities - license.resourcepool = sampleResourcePool was creating new resource pools!
either work with Ids, or try to work on merging unitofwork classes

. implement soft delete
. find vs. deleted records? - findlive? or don't retrieve dead records at all?
. exists should work with find or alllive.any() or all.any() ?
. don't allow delete License if it's connected to an Organization (can't be deleted) - same goes for the others but License really can't be deleted

. multiple pk for user organization + user sector + user license + user resource pool organization + resource pool organization
. table structure - by this way, userresourcepool could reach to usersectorrating easily?;
user - resourcepool - userresourcepoolId
userresourcepoolsector -> userresourcepoolId sectorId rating
userresourcepoollicense -> userresourcepoolId licenseId rating
userresourcepoolorganization -> userresourcepoolId organizationId rating

. authorize only for admins didnt work - license, organization, resourcepool, sector
any user should be able to access them. currently definitions link is only visible to admins - according to this, normal user may not use post action for instance? check these rules later on

. loading animation? both for breeze + angular
. enum data type didnt work with odata? or api?
. html cache break - angular scripts + views etc.?
. using texbox to update chart data didn't work, it breaks the chart?
. use or try to remove scripts.render() + styles.render() from layout.cshtml - then mvc can be removed completely
. automate .tt scripts with afterbuild?
. try to have a standard for css usage + html layout formats + also js script conventions
. check spelling of the texts!
. update namespaces - ?.wealtheconomy.
. enable auto test for appveyor - currently it fails probably because it can't create the db?
. in some delete cases, odatacontroller returns NotFound error? although it's deleted, the record stays on the page until refreshing the page
. __migrationhistory createdon field error - it seems there is not much to do, it also might be about glimpse?
. upgrade to .net 4.5.1? APM doesn't have it right now

. default license ratings should be 50/50
. and ratings total should always be 100%
. create sample data with average rating value? or make the rating nullable
. exclude sample user from rating averages - or make them always 50 / 50?
. how to calculate average index? some people may enter 1,2,3 - some may enter 100,200,300? always force them to enter percentage?
or always calculate the total average based on invidiuals percentage? or both?
. should cmrp rate be on user level? if not, there is no average for cmrp rate for now?
. in 'not rated index' case, userResourcePool view doesn't show the result
. in 'not rated organizations' case, it's collecting the tax but not giving it back? - basically how to treat an organization that doesn't have any rating?

. inserting a new userresourcepoolindex gave an error?

. validateantiforgerytoken + bind attributes in odata controller?

. odata - paging (also filters?)
querayable vs enablequerysupport
[Queryable(PageSize=10)]

var queryAttribute = new QueryableAttribute()
{
    AllowedQueryOptions = AllowedQueryOptions.Top | AllowedQueryOptions.Skip,
    MaxTop = 100
};
config.EnableQuerySupport(queryAttribute);

. try turning off lazy loading - then how it brings the data (resourcepool for instance?)
.. currently there seem no good case that lazy loading is beneficial?
. and how about disabling proxy classes? what will be the difference exactly?

. vs update 2 + 3 changes -> asp.net identity

. check user[x]rating tables usage, do they need filtering?

. employee + customer + quality index samples are not there
. all in one + sector samples are outdated

. highcharts library loading perf?

. check userunitofwork + resourcepoolunitofwork + userresourcepoolunitofwork for sample records + delete cases
. check chapters knowledge + sector indexes

. element fields; text, bool, integer, decimal
. element parent + child structure
. fixed amount resourcepooltype

---
sector index - just name and the rating
license index - name + boolean variables (allows to see the code, allows modification, allows sell) and the rating
organization total cost index - auto formula (organization sales price / resource pool sales price average)
