. breeze - check save + has + get + reject changes. currently they don't work on entity level? - also prepareBatch method?

. sometimes cancel button doesn't allow to go back (fill required?)
.. use history.back sort of method, but first vm needs to be a new object, without createEntity

. learn this disposable thingy? repo + unitofwork + context + controllers?
. handling concurrency can be improved - load the new record and let the user choose which one is correct
. try to create initial data from facade, instead of dataobjects layer
. try to merge unit of work classes - resourcepool unitofwork could create sector + license + organization for instance?
.. however, in the current structure, every entity will have a unitofwork + controller by default?
.. be careful about different contexts entities - license.resourcepool = sampleResourcePool was creating new resource pools!
either work with Ids, or try to work on merging unitofwork classes

. implement soft delete
. find vs. deleted records? - findlive? or don't retrieve dead records at all?
. exists should work with find or alllive.any() or all.any() ?
. don't allow delete License if it's connected to an Organization (can't be deleted) - same goes for the others but License really can't be deleted

. multiple pk for user organization + user sector + user license + user resource pool organization + resource pool organization
. table structure - by this way, userresourcepool could reach to usersectorrating easily?;
user - resourcepool - userresourcepoolId
userresourcepoolsector -> userresourcepoolId sectorId rating
userresourcepoollicense -> userresourcepoolId licenseId rating
userresourcepoolorganization -> userresourcepoolId organizationId rating

. authorize only for admins didnt work - license, organization, resourcepool, sector
any user should be able to access them. currently definitions link is only visible to admins - according to this, normal user may not use post action for instance? check these rules later on

. loading animation? both for breeze + angular
. enum data type didnt work with odata? or api?
. html cache break - angular scripts + views etc.?
. using texbox to update chart data didn't work, it breaks the chart?
. use or try to remove scripts.render() + styles.render() from layout.cshtml - then mvc can be removed completely
. automate .tt scripts with afterbuild?
. try to have a standard for css usage + html layout formats + also js script conventions
. check spelling of the texts!
. update namespaces - ?.wealtheconomy.
. enable auto test for appveyor - currently it fails probably because it can't create the db?
. in some delete cases, odatacontroller returns NotFound error? although it's deleted, the record stays on the page until refreshing the page
. __migrationhistory createdon field error - it seems there is not much to do, it also might be about glimpse?
. upgrade to .net 4.5.1? APM doesn't have it right now
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh925568%28v=vs.110%29.aspx
. what to do these lines; datacontext.js - batches.push(manager.getEntities(['License'], [breeze.EntityState.Deleted]));

. default license ratings should be 50/50
. and ratings total should always be 100%
. create sample data with average rating value? or make the rating nullable
. exclude sample user from rating averages - or make them always 50 / 50?
. how to calculate average index? some people may enter 1,2,3 - some may enter 100,200,300? always force them to enter percentage?
or always calculate the total average based on invidiuals percentage? or both?
. should cmrp rate be on user level? if not, there is no average for cmrp rate for now!!!
. in 'not rated index' case, userResourcePool view doesn't show the result
. in 'not rated organizations' case, it's collecting the tax but not giving it back? - basically how to treat an organization that doesn't have any rating?

. check [required] attribute for newer classes?

. inserting a new userresourcepoolindex gave an error?

. validateantiforgerytoken + bind attributes in odata controller?

. odata - paging (also filters?)
querayable vs enablequerysupport
[Queryable(PageSize=10)]

var queryAttribute = new QueryableAttribute()
{
    AllowedQueryOptions = AllowedQueryOptions.Top | AllowedQueryOptions.Skip,
    MaxTop = 100
};
config.EnableQuerySupport(queryAttribute);

. try turning off lazy loading - then how it brings the data (resourcepool for instance?)
.. currently there seem no good case that lazy loading is beneficial?
. and how about disabling proxy classes? what will be the difference exactly?

. result of datetime (ticks) index is bit useless? need reference a start or end date as a reference?

. vs update 2 + 3 changes -> asp.net identity + odata4

. Install-Package Microsoft.AspNet.WebApi.HelpPage

.. gather these under performance / optimization
. web.config httpcompression?
. miniprofiler - is this similar with glimpse?

. automapper?

. javascript logging; http://jsnlog.com/

. what happened to appveyor?

. karma js tester?

. http://ricostacruz.com/nprogress/ ?

. [Route("users/{id:int:min(1)}")] ?

. composite key definition;
[Key]
[Column(Order = 0)]
public int LocationID { get; set; }
[Key]
[Column(Order = 1)]
public int DayID { get; set; }
[Key]
[Column(Order = 2)]
public int TimeID { get; set; }
[Key]
[Column(Order = 3)]
public string LanguageID { get; set; }

. check user[x]rating tables usage, do they need filtering?

. employee + customer + quality index samples are not there
. all in one + sector samples are outdated

. ResourcePoolIndexOrganization class should be internal, not public - find the others! don't use them in tests

. highcharts library loading perf?

. warm-up script?

. check userunitofwork + resourcepoolunitofwork + userresourcepoolunitofwork for sample records + delete cases

. update configuration.cs with element fields
. make even the name as a element item and create it automatically when the element is created

. currently multiplier + resource pool field types can only be added once per element (or resource pool) - check it again

. element parent + child structure

. fixed amount resourcepooltype

. add multiple fields test

. models to Models folder

. ismainelement -> DefaultElement
. elementfield -> elementColumn
. elementitem -> elementRow
. elementitemelementfield -> elementcell
. resourcepoolindex can be a field for elementfield table? Index boolean?
. multiplier field type -> userelementitemelementfield can hold just the value but will be used as it is, not it's average (like Rating)
currently number of sales is not on user level, but on elementitem level!
. userelementitemelementfield rating -> value?
. TotalResourcePoolFieldItemValueIncludingResourcePoolAddition -> !?!?!?!?
. instead of MainElement boolean on Element level, can it be done with MainElement field on ResourcePool level? yes, with InverseProperty
. subtotals; sales price, sales price incl. tax, number of sales, total tax, total sales price incl. tax, total income
. userelementitemelementfield ratings + counts?
. display index's own ratings + counts?

. userResourcePool view recursive selectedElementItem part

. CONTINUE WITH;
check seed function + test + chapters (samples) etc.
then clean all the obsolete stuff, including organization ?!
