            Today we're facing many issues that are related with how the economic system works, like;

                The aim of the economic system is (could be defined as) to allocate most resources to the most productive, fair and generous organizations in the society and in the current system we are failing to achieve this task.
            </span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="reviewLater">
                - The consumer has the power of doing this allocation but -
            </span>
        </p>
        <p>
            The core problem could be defined as the Burden of the Consumer.
        </p>
        <p>
            The consumers actually know what is important for them. If before purchasing any product or service, all hidden but important details of every product and organization could be revealed to the consumer, <span class="reviewLater">she (?)</span> could make the right choice.
        </p>
        <p>
            However the problem is that there are just too many products and massive number of details that the consumer should gather and process before making any decision. We believe this is an impractical expectation. <span class="reviewLater">A single family needs more than 200 different items from a market every month and  there are more than 10 firms for even a toilet paper.</span>
        </p>
        <h2>Crowd Managed Resource Pool</h2>
        <p>
            However, if all the resources could be collected into one pool and distributed to the organizations through peoples <span class="reviewLater">early(?)</span> collective decisions (by having some additional parameters), we could have a much more fair result.
        </p>
        <p>
            This pool could contain following parameters;
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Total Cost Index: How much the organization is profit oriented. <span class="reviewLater">Would you reward a firm that produces for 1 and sells for 5 or the one produces for 1 and sells for 1</span>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Knowledge Sharing Index: How much the organization provides its know how and rights. <span class="reviewLater">Would you reward a firm that shares its knowledge so every company dont have to invent fire again on its own.</span>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Quality Index: What level of quality the product has. <span class="reviewLater">Would not you want to buy the more durable or non-toxic item</span>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Sector Index: Allows people decide which sectors are more important for them. <span class="reviewLater">Do you know that if asked people want to spend more to healthcare but spend more to beauty products in the end.</span>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Employee Satisfaction Index: How much standardized(?) are the rights of employees. <span class="reviewLater">Would you want to reward a firm whose employees are happy to work there.</span>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Customer Satisfaction Index: How much the company aims to please consumers. <span class="reviewLater">Don't you want to reward the firm which has satisfied its customers.</span>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Distance Index: How close the production facility is to its consumers. <span class="reviewLater">Think about used resources when the production is far from the stalls.</span>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Distribution indexes Pie: Determines the weight of above parameters to each other in the system. <span class="reviewLater">Which of these parameters are more important for you.</span>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>
            Implementation
        </h3>
        <p>
            Ideal way of implementing this resource pool would be to collect some portion of the money from every transaction, like value added tax but with two important exceptions;

            <ul>
                <li>
                    The people will control how it will be distributed
                </li>
                <li>
                    Every organization in the system can get a share from this pie
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="reviewLater">(In the end value added tax returns to the employees and therefore to people)</span>
                </li>
            </ul>
