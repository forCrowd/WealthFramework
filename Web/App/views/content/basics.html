            <p>
                In the following sample, there are four organizations that are equal to each other in every aspect, except they use different strategies to motivate their employees.
                In <code>Existing Model</code>, since this difference is ignored, each organization will have the same <code>Total Income</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
                <code>New Model</code> introduces <code>Employee Satisfaction Index</code>.
                By using this index, we can enter which organization's employees satisfied with their organization's strategy
                and based on this new data, organizations' <code>Total Income</code> will now differ.
            </p>

                <h4>Difference between the models</h4>
                <p>
                    Since <code>New Model</code> uses CMRP, it requires an amount to be distributed.
                    This amount will automatically be calculated and it's 10% of the total spendings in the system.
                    This approach will be used throughout the samples and the details will be explained in further chapters.

                    In <code>Existing Model</code>, increase organizations' <code>Number of Sales</code> by clicking <code>+</code> button.<br />
                    This will increase <code>Number of Sales</code> in both models to be able compare the results easily.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In <code>New Model</code>, update <code>Employee Satisfaction Rating</code> of the organizations by using <code>+</code> and <code>-</code> buttons next to them
                    and see the difference in <code>Total Income</code> fields in both models.
                </li>

                    Toggle <code>Display</code> between <code>Only My Ratings</code> and <code>All Ratings</code> to see only your ratings or the average of all users'.

                If we could measure "Employee Satisfaction" of the organizations in real life, we could reward the ones with a higher rating as in this sample.
                Adding indexes to the system sets additional priorities for the organizations, instead of just focusing to profit.

            <p>
                Although only four <!-- TODO four or three or five? update this number at the end --> different indexes will be presented in the following chapters,
                as long as they are measurable, more indexes can be added into the system.
                <!--Indexes can have static values or they be rated by the users.-->
