            The second issue is that the rest of the responsibility falls to the consumers. If the consumers could make
            the right choices in the market and reward the correct organizations, based on their overall benefits, we could have some better results.
            However, to achieve this task, every individual consumer must be able gather, process and even compare every piece of knowledge
            of each product and organization in the market.
