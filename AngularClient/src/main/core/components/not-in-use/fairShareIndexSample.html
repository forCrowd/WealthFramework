      Most of the organizations in the market uses a classic approach;
      the business owner makes the initial investment while creating the business and sets the rules in favor of himself,
      most importantly this lets him to get all the profit.
      Meaning that even after years of work and significant contributions, most of the employees will not get a share from organization's income
      but get a fixed salary. In the long term, since the organization owners keep getting a bigger pie from the income and not sharing it accordingly,
      this type of income distribution becomes another root cause of 'Income Inequality'.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we could encourage organizations to measure or at least consider all contributions, including the owner's initial investment,
      and then share the income to anyone in the organization, we could prevent this dynamic and fixed income difference.
      Such approach would have a significant impact on the society in overall, the difference between the owners and the workers would be much more small and fair.
    </p>
    <!--<p>
        Although giving shares to employees is not something new, it is used in a nonstandard way, by limited organizations
        and the organizations are not explicitly rewarded for this approach.
        On the contrary, it could be used in a much wider sense and be encouraged in a systematic way.
        !--There are already many organizations that give some share to their employees, especially startups,
        in order to motivate them. However, it's still very limited and this approach could be used in a much wider sense and be encouraged in a systematic way.--
        !--It's important to note that if an organization tries this approach, share the income with its employees in a fair way, in the current system,
        this wouldn't have any financial benefit to that organization. At best, the organization could try to communicate with its consumer about this detail,
        which may or may not increase their sales number.--

      <!--By using <strong>Fair Share Index</strong>, we can categorize the organizations into "Sharers" vs. "Keepers".-->
      By using <strong>Fair Share Index</strong>, we can categorize the organizations by their approach on how they distribute their income,
      whether they share the profit with their employees or not.
      <!--By using <strong>Fair Share Index</strong>, we can categorize the organizations by their approach of how they distribute their income,
      whether they ignore or count the various contributions from their workers.-->
    </p>
    <p>
      In the following example, we will use two categories under Fair Share Index;
      <ul>
        <li>Keepers: Uses the classic approach; the owner gets all the profit, workers get a fixed salary.</li>
        <li>Sharers: Considers contributions from all parties and share the income based on this outcome.</li>
      </ul>
      Again it's up to us to decide and rate these categories.
      Then the organizations will get an income from the pool based on their approach.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        By using <code>+</code> button increase <strong>Number of Sales</strong>, initially all organizations will have same <strong>Total Income</strong>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Click on <code>Fair Share</code> link below and rate both items based on their importance.
      </li>
      <li>
        Go back to initial view to see the difference in Total Income.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <resource-pool-editor data-config="{ resourcePoolId: 0 }"></resource-pool-editor>
    <p>
      Unlike the other indexes, Fair Share Index doesn't have a solid base as a difference between the organization.
      It requires a standard method to be developed; how to make a distinction between 'Sharer' and 'Keeper' organizations.
      When an organization declares that it is a 'Sharer', how to ensure that this is actually the case.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, one of the important parts to be an owner of an organization is to have various responsibilities.
      For example, what will happen when the organization is going to be smaller or will get bankrupt?
      Therefore, sharing the income should also mean sharing the responsibilities?
      To be able to deal with these type of details, we may need new type of contracts between organizations and workers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today, as a legal form, 'Non-Profit Organization' can be the closest approach that can cover Fair Share Index and can be a good starting point.
      Otherwise, without studying it further, this might be the least practical index within these samples.
      Still, we believe it is a good food for thought on how we could approach to 'Income Inequality' issue.
    </p>
    <!--<p>
        Developing a standard for measuring the contributions is not in the scope of this project.
        Obviously it is not an easy task and would require many discussions from various parties.
        Certain questions need to be addressed;
        <ul>
            <li>What will be the advantages of being the owner and taking the initiative?</li>
            <li>
                Even if the organization doesn't have enough income, some workers would like to get paid for their service.
                What would be the benefit of taking a risk and investing in the organization in the long term?
            </li>
            <li>Should the negative contributions be counted and how much they should affect the income?</li>
            <li>What should happen if an organization is getting smaller?</li>
            <li>
                When an organization declares that it shares the income based on contributions,
                how this could actually be ensured and by who, by official inspectors, workers or other citizens?
            </li>
        </ul>
        Without answering these questions and having a standard, <strong>Fair Share Index</strong> might be the least practical index within these samples.
        Still, we believe it is a good example on how we could approach to "Income Inequality" issue.
