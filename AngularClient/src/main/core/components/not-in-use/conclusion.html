      Conclusion
    </h3>
    <p>
      The main idea of this project is to show what are the possibilities, to give an idea what we could do to solve our issues.
      Rest of the details is open for discussion.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we see economic systems as a way of resource distribution, it is clear that the existing system can be improved dramatically.
      <!--If we see economic systems as a way of resource allocation, it is clear that existing system is not a very productive one and there is a big room for improvement.-->
      Good news is that the technology is getting better at an accelerated speed, so our chances of creating new solutions.
      <!--Good news is that we already have the most of the components, like tax collection and tax return systems and the technology is getting better at an accelerated speed.
      Only missing piece is the direct input of the society.-->
    </p>
    <h4>Impossible Task</h4>
    <p>
      It should be mentioned that we already have two important tools to improve the current system;
      <ol>
        <li>Competition between the organizations</li>
        <li>Increasing the awareness of the consumers</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-6">
    <p>
      Both serves for the benefit of the society and even if we don't develop applications like this one, these tools will be improving the system in the long run;
      competition will allow us to have better organizations in time and
      by increasing the awareness, consumers will have better knowledge about the organizations, so they will choose the right ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      However this still would be an unnecessarily slow process.
      If an organization has a clear advantage for the society, the system could be modified in such a way that it could support this benefit automatically.
      <!-- we don't have to wait for every consumer to understand its value.-->
    </p>
    <p>
      The main issue in the current system is that it leaves the whole responsibility to the consumers;
      <u>every consumer must know every detail about the products and their organizations before making any single purchase</u>, therefore allocating the resources.
      The amount of information has to be collected and processed by each consumer is simply massive and expecting consumers to fulfill this task is an impractical one.
    </p>
    <p>
      In today's system, this knowledge gap is closed by marketing; the consumers make their choices not based on facts but based on advertisements, packages and colors.
      <!--Marketing is a powerful tool and will always play a role but controlling the consumers and shaping the results only based on feelings is not enough for a good resource management.-->
      Marketing is a powerful tool and will always play a role but
      influencing the consumers at such level and shaping the outcome is not our best interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      We need complex applications to be able to manage our resources, in order to have healthier and more productive society.
      Creating such solution is a long shot and this project is just a small step.
      <!--There are many areas to be improved, functionality, performance, security and so on.-->
      There are many parts to be studied and it will take time to create something solid.
      However, developing a such solution could play a vital role on solving some of society's long term issues.
      <!--It might take couple of years to create a solid application. However, developing such systems might play an important role on solving some of society's long term issues.-->
    </p>

      Therefore we are on this journey. Would you like to support us?
      <!--Therefore we are on this side of the river. Would you like to support us?-->
      <!--Therefore we are on this side of the river. Would you like to join?-->
      <!--Therefore we are on this journey now, wanna get on board?-->
