      Roadmap
    </h3>
    <p>
      Wealth Economy will be used as a simulation platform for a while.
      It will allow anyone to create experimental pools with various indexes, in order to find the best combinations.
    </p>
    <p>
      When it gets mature enough, it could be used in couple ways, like;
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Reference System: If enough data and ratings will be collected, first and easiest way to benefit from the outcome would be to use it just as a reference database, without having and allocating any money.
          Before making any purchase, consumers could visit this website and see which product or organization has the highest score for certain indexes and then make a decision.
          Sort of 'User Reviews' of online shopping websites. Easiest way to use but least affective.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Concerned Citizens: In order to make an actual change, there has to be an amount in our pools and allocate them based on the outcome.
          One way of doing this is to reach and convince enough citizens that this way of allocating resources could shape and improve how our organizations work, therefore the entire system.
          Once concerned citizens start donating enough money to the system, it can start distributing this amount to the organizations within the system based on their performance.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Full Package: In the long term, Wealth Economy aims to be an alternative resource allocation system for the society. In order to see its full effect, it must be implemented at nations' level.
          CMRP Amount should be collected from each transaction, like a value added tax. As it should be clear by now, CMRP Rate in this system represents that tax rate, how much we should collect and allocate tax for this purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
          It must be noted that there are two important differences than the classic tax system;
          <ul>
            <li>The amount will be controlled by the people, will be allocated by our choices.</li>
            <li>And it will be distributed back to the same organizations again. Every organization has a chance get an income from this pool, only this time they will get an amount based on their benefits to the society.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <!--<p>
            Creating a national fund by the governments could also be an option, Horizon 2020 program in Europe for example.
            However, the money eventually comes from the people and usually by collecting taxes.
        </p>-->
        <p>
          This level of implementation requires a political power, huge numbers of people need to be convinced for the benefits of using such system.
          On the other hand, if we could directly control some our resources, its impact would that huge as well; most difficult way to use but most effective.
          <!--Today we are trying to patch the system for various issues over and over, we are rallying, protesting and usually keep spending our energy only to solve a single problem.
          Instead, we could do one big push to implement such system and at least we could directly control some of our resources collectively and this could let us solve multiple issues at the same time.-->
        </p>
        <!--<p>
            In the long term, when enough people will be convinced in a certain country, they could create pressure on their political parties to adopt this system and implement it when they get elected.
        </p>-->
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      To make some parts clear:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        In order to make it simple, in the samples, collecting money for the pool and distributing it is happening at the same.
        In reality, the amount could be collected at one time and then allocated to the organizations later on, for instance monthly or yearly.
      </li>
      <li>
        The system doesn't have to be used with multiple indexes, it could start with only one index.
        We believe, 'Knowledge Index' is the one that can be easily implemented and could have the highest impact.
        It is a matter of having reliable ratings for various licenses and then it will already tell us how much we could have make a difference.
      </li>
      <li>
        For 'Full Package' case, the system initially could be implemented with a small and a fixed CMRP Rate that can be set by the government.
        If everything goes well, the rate could be incremented slowly over time.
        In other words, the system could be controlled in a mixed way; some parts by the governments, others by the citizens.
      </li>
    </ul>
