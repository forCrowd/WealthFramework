      Today we are facing many major issues due to how the economic system works, more specifically how we distribute our resources.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the main purposes of the economic system is to allocate resources, ideally to the organizations with the most benefits to the society.
      First issue in the system is, that there is no systematic way to measure and reward the benefits, like productiveness, fairness towards employees
      or even high quality. Naturally the only parameter that is left to measure gets all the focus: the profit. In other words, in the current system,
      the primary goal of the majority of the organizations is to gain more profit, everything else can be secondary.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second issue is that the rest of the responsibility falls to the consumers. If the consumers could make
      the right choices in the market and reward the correct organizations, based on their overall benefits, we could have some better results.
      However, to achieve this task, every individual consumer must be able gather, process and even compare every piece of information
      of each product / service and organization in the market.
    </p>
    <p>
      We believe that expecting consumers to fulfill this task is an impractical one. Instead, we need to focus on measuring the benefits.

      Wealth Framework is an attempt to create an open source software that provides a flexible and customizable system that defines the benefits,
      measures them, then allocate resources to the organizations, based on determining how much these benefits have been satisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the items that could be used to measure the benefits;
      <ul>
        <li>
          Priority Index: Which sector does the organization operate in? How critical the issues that the organization deal with?
          Does it try to cure cancer or prevent baldness?
        </li>
        <li>
          Knowledge Index: How much the organization shares its know-how with the people and provides flexible rights?
          Does it hide its knowledge, so the other organizations need to spend similar time and energy to rediscover the same knowledge
          or share its knowledge and prevent this?
        </li>
        <li>
          Total Cost Index: How much the organization costs to the society to provide its products / services?
          In other words, how much the organization is profit oriented.
        </li>
        <li>
          Quality Index: What level of quality the organization's product has? Does the product last longer,
          does it have a better functionality than its competitors or simply healthy enough?
        </li>
        <li>
          Employee Satisfaction Index: How the organization treat to its workers? What are the working conditions?
          Does it have proper insurance for its employees?
        </li>
        <li>
          Customer Satisfaction Index: How much the company aims to please its customers? How good are the experiences of previous customers?
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      The list can be extended with various items. The people could vote to determine which parameters should be used
      and their importance within each other. The rest is up to the organizations, more benefits to the society means more resources.
    </p>
    <p>
      This system could be implemented next to the existing systems. Ideal way of creating a "resource pool" that the people can control through this system,
      would be to collect some portion of the money from every transaction, like value added tax but with two important exceptions;
      <ul>
        <li>
          Every organization in the system will get a share from this pie based on their performance
        </li>
        <li>
          And the people will control how this pool will be distributed
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
