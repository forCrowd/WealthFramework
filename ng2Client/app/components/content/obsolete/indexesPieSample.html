            Indexes Pie
        </h3>
        <p>
            In the previous samples, there was one index per CMRP.
            However in most cases, there will be mixture of indexes to determine which organization is more beneficial to the society.
            Since not every index is equally important, their share within the pool also need to be set.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Indexes</strong> view allows us to compare and rate each index within the pool.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the following example, we will see one organization with previously mentioned indexes.
            Here is a quick summary of the indexes:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Priority Index:</strong>
                    What type of issues that the organization tries to solve, how fundamental they are? Does it try to cure cancer or baldness?
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Knowledge Index:</strong>
                    Does the organization hide its knowledge, so the other organizations need to spend similar time and energy
                    to rediscover the same or shares it with the society and prevents this?
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Total Cost Index:</strong>
                    How much the organization costs to the society to provide its products, services?
                    In other words, how much the organization is profit oriented.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Fair Share Index:</strong>
                    Does the organization share its income with its employees by considering contributions for each member,
                    or the owner' keeps it to himself?
                </li>
            </ul>
            Please rate these indexes based on their importance and set how much an index should control the amount in the pool.
        </p>
